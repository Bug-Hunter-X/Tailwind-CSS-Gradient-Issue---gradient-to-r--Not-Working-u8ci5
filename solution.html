    <p>This gradient should now work correctly.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Solution:  The issue might have been caused by a missing or incorrect configuration in your `tailwind.config.js` file or a conflict with another CSS rule.  Make sure your Tailwind config includes the gradient plugin and that the `theme` section defines colors correctly.  Use browser developer tools to inspect any CSS conflicts.</p>
