# Tailwind CSS Gradient Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet uncommon bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS gradients. Specifically, the `gradient-to-r` class doesn't produce the expected output.  This is often caused by configuration issues, CSS conflicts, plugin problems, or simple typos.

## The Problem
The `bug.html` file contains a simple div element styled with a gradient.  However, the gradient might not render correctly. This is not a typical 'missing import' or syntax error, but rather a more subtle issue related to Tailwind's configuration or interaction with other CSS.

## The Solution
The `solution.html` file shows the corrected code and explains the potential causes and solutions. This involves checking the Tailwind configuration, resolving CSS conflicts, and ensuring proper plugin installation and version compatibility.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser. Observe the unexpected or missing gradient.
3. Examine `solution.html` for the corrected code and explanation of the potential causes.
