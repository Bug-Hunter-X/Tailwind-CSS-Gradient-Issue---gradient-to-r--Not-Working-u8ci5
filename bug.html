This code uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling. However, if the `gradient-to-r` class doesn't work or produces unexpected results, it might be due to a few uncommon reasons:

1. **Incorrect configuration:** Ensure your Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.cjs`) is correctly set up and includes the `gradient` plugin.  The `theme` section might need adjustments if you're using custom colors.
2. **Conflicting CSS:** Another CSS rule might be overriding Tailwind's styles. Check for conflicting styles by inspecting the browser's developer tools.
3. **Plugin issue:** If you've added the `gradient` plugin recently, ensure it's correctly installed and imported. Try restarting your development server.
4. **Typographical errors:** Double-check for any typos in the class names. Even a small mistake can lead to unexpected behavior.
5. **Version incompatibility:** Ensure your Tailwind CSS version is compatible with your other dependencies and that all packages are updated to their latest versions.
